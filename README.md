# Dog-Breed-Identification Using AI and ML
This repository contains the source code for a Flask web application that identifies the breed of a dog from an uploaded image using a pre-trained deep learning model. Additionally, the application provides information about the predicted breed, including characteristics and basic needs, retrieved from the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.

## Features
- **Dog Breed Identification:** The application uses a pre-trained deep learning model to predict the breed of a dog based on an uploaded image.

- **Breed Information:** The predicted breed's characteristics are fetched from the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to provide users with basic information about the breed.

- **Breed Needs:** The application also queries the GPT-3 model for information about the basic needs of the predicted dog breed, assisting users in understanding the requirements of the breed before adoption.
